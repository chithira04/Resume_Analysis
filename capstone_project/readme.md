# Smart Resume Screener & Job Recommendation Portal-Capstone Project

## Overview

The aim of this project is to build an intelligent and user-friendly web application
that automatically analyzes uploaded resumes using NLP-driven Machine Learning
models and identifies the most suitable job roles for each candidate. Along with
predicting role fit, the system recommends relevant job openings from the
database and highlights key strengths and skill gaps, helping users improve their
career readiness.

This dual-purpose platform not only assists HR professionals by automating the
initial screening process but also empowers job seekers with personalized career
insights, making the hiring process smarter, faster, and more effective for both
sides.

## Model Performance

The following machine learning models were evaluated:

| **Rank** | **Model**                 | **Accuracy** |
| :------: | ------------------------- | :----------: |
|     1    | Random Forest             |  **96.92%**  |
|     2    | Logistic Regression       |  **92.31%**  |
|     3    | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |  **89.23%**  |


For deployment, Random Forest can be used to predict job categories.

## Application Workflow

1. Upload a resume (PDF)
2. Extract resume text
3. Convert text into TF-IDF vectors
4. Predict the job category
5. Display the predicted category
6. Recommend top matching job roles

- Resume match score
- HR dashboard
- Candidate ranking
- Resume support for DOCX format
- Online job API integration
- User authentication
- Resume improvement suggestions
